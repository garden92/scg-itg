# Architectural Assessment

## Current Architecture Strengths

### ‚úÖ Well-Implemented Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern**
   - EndpointStrategyResolver with priority-based strategy selection
   - Clean separation of endpoint determination logic (CRM, ORD, Stub)
   - Extensible design for new service types

2. **Modular Monolithic Structure**
   - Clear separation: `app` (application layer), `common` (shared components)
   - Proper dependency management through Maven modules
   - Spring profile-based configuration for environments

3. **Reactive Architecture**
   - Spring Cloud Gateway with WebFlux
   - Non-blocking I/O throughout the request pipeline
   - Proper error propagation with Mono chains

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Profile-based configuration (local, dev, sit, prd)
   - Externalized properties for different environments
   - Circuit breaker configuration per environment

### üîç Architecture Observations

1. **Filter Chain Design**
   - GlobalBmonLoggingFilterFactory: Performance-optimized async logging
   - GlobalRequestValidationFilter: Input validation
   - RewriteGlobalFilter: Request transformation
   - Well-structured filter pipeline

2. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Global ErrorHandler for centralized error processing
   - Custom business exceptions with error codes
   - Proper error response formatting

3. **Integration Patterns**
   - SOAP/REST transformation through SoapConverter
   - Template-based XML generation for performance
   - Feign client configuration for external services

## Areas for Improvement

### üîß Code Organization
- Some utility classes could be further abstracted
- Exception handling could be more centralized
- Template caching strategy could be enhanced

### üìà Scalability Considerations
- Connection pool configuration review needed
- Memory usage monitoring for template cache
- Metrics and monitoring integration
